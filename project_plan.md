# Nuclear Power Plant Accident Detection System Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal is to develop a real-time accident detection system for nuclear power plants using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with Attention Mechanism. The system will analyze continuous time-series data of operational parameters and predict potential Reactor Scram events within the next 5 minutes.

## Dataset Analysis
- 12 different accident types (LOCA, SGBTR, LR, MD, SGATR, SLBIC, LOCAC, RI, FLB, LLB, SLBOC, RW)
- 100 simulations per accident type with varying severity (1% to 100%)
- Each simulation contains:
  - Time series data (97 operational parameters, 10-second intervals)
  - Transient Report (detailed event log with Reactor Scram timestamps)

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing Pipeline
#### 1.1 Data Loading and Organization
- Create a data loader class to handle:
  - Reading CSV files containing time series data
  - Parsing Transient Report files to extract Reactor Scram timestamps
  - Organizing data by accident type and severity
  - Creating a unified data structure for training

#### 1.2 Time Series Processing
- Implement sliding window mechanism:
  - Window size: 5 minutes (30 time steps at 10-second intervals)
  - Stride: 1 time step (10 seconds)
  - For each window:
    - Input: 30 time steps × 97 parameters
    - Label: Binary (1 if Reactor Scram occurs in next 5 minutes, 0 otherwise)

#### 1.3 Feature Engineering
- Normalize all parameters to [0,1] range
- Calculate derived features:
  - Rate of change for critical parameters
  - Rolling statistics (mean, std) for key parameters
  - Parameter correlations within each window

#### 1.4 Data Validation
- Implement checks for:
  - Missing values
  - Data consistency
  - Label distribution
  - Temporal continuity

### 2. Model Architecture
#### 2.1 Temporal Convolutional Network
- Input layer: 97 parameters × 30 time steps
- Multiple TCN blocks:
  - Each block contains:
    - Temporal convolution layer
    - Batch normalization
    - ReLU activation
    - Dropout (0.2)
  - Residual connections between blocks
  - Increasing dilation rates (1, 2, 4, 8)

#### 2.2 Attention Mechanism
- Self-attention layer:
  - Query, Key, Value projections
  - Multi-head attention (4 heads)
  - Positional encoding
- Cross-attention layer:
  - Parameter relationships
  - Temporal dependencies

#### 2.3 Output Layer
- Dense layer with sigmoid activation
- Binary classification (accident/no accident)

### 3. Training Strategy
#### 3.1 Data Splitting
